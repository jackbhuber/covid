The survey was conducted via mail and web from January 27 – March 21, 2021, with a random sample of 1,248 adults ages 18 and older, living in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. Gallup randomly selected individuals to participate using an address-based sample (ABS) frame. Respondents had the opportunity to respond to the survey via web or paper. Surveys were conducted in English and Spanish. The final response rate to this survey was 11.3% (AAPOR1). Samples were weighted to correct for unequal selection probability and nonresponse. Demographic weighting targets are based on the 2020 American Community Survey figures for the 18 and older population. The data were weighted to match national demographics of age, education, gender, race, ethnicity, and Census region.\n\n## Participants\n\nThe source of data for this project is Wave VI of the Baylor Religion Survey.
